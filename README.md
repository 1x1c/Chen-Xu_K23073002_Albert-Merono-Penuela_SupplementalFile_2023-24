data_collection.py is used to collect and extend the dataset.

Comparison.ipynb,Comparison(2).ipynb,Comparison(3).ipynb are about the Basic Network Metrics Comparison , Degree Distribution Comparison, community counts comparison between Different types of multimedia editor networks and random networks.

Community Detection and Node Characteristic.ipynb is about using louvain Algorithm to nanlyze community structure and using hypothesis test to find the gaps in node centrality.



full_data_Fisher_MW_betweenness_centrality.csv,full_data_Fisher_MW_closeness_centrality.csv,full_data_Fisher_MW_degree_centrality.csv,full_data_Fisher_MW_eigenvector_centrality.csv are the output of
the hypothesis test of node characteristic,it is about  the trends of p-values.
